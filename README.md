# bash
Bash script for renaming files in DDMMYYYY.txt format. For files with the same creation date the script changes the original file name in format DDMMYYYY.txt for the first file and add extra file extension for each following files, DDMMYYYY.txt.~1~ for the second file, DDMMYYYY.txt.~2~ for the third and etc. For each renamed file the console app sends an output “Renamed”. For each no .txt file in the entered directory the console app sends an output "It's not a txt file".
